-32053.0078125 of standard MACD run.

This is the PNL (profit and loss) represented by a bare bone robotic MACD strategy. I say robotic and bare bone 
because there are no other additional confluences given other than the MACD and signal lines. 

A little background about the MACD strategy. The MACD (moving average convergence/divergence) is a technical indicator originally used for 
securities, created by a man named Gerald Appel in the 1970s. It is meant to dipict the direction of momentum of price.
To this day, the MACD is an extremely popular indicator. If you were to search up on youtube "trading indicator", and then sort by most amount of views, 
"Most Effective MACD Strategy for Daytrading Crypto, Forex & Stocks (High Winrate Strategy)" is the third video, with a whopping 2.3 million views. 
From a more personal standpoint, a trading youtuber I watched swore by the MACD indicator, saying things like "oh its so easy" and "anyone can do it". 
Well if it is, then why doesn't everyone use it? Well its not that simple actually.

For those who don't know, the MACD and signal lines are calculated by different exponential moving averages (EMA's),
taking the EMA of each candle close since the start of the data set as far back as possible. Throughout trading, traders observe 
that certain EMA's under certain timeframes can be used an indicator of where price will either comeback to, or fall. 

For the MACD strategy, it is used as a "momentum" indicator. When the MACD line moves above the signal line, it is a bullish indicator 
(bullish usually refers to price going up). When the MACD line moves below the signal line, it is a bearish (refering to price decreasing) signal. 
Sounds simple right? Well thats all it is. 


What the data shows: 
The data from this rudimentary backtest shows that the MACD on first glance is not profitable at all. Infact, it puts you deep in debt. So how can this be?
Well for one, the backtest took every signal it got as a trade. On first glance this doesn't seem like a bad thing, but the human aspect is important in 
trading for this reason; that not every trade signal is a smart one. For example, you might get a signal to buy, but what you didn't know is that there is 
breaking news in the tech industry that will disrupt the market intensely, and cause the price to drop (a lot of these news "events" are scheduled, so typically 
traders know when the market will be impacted by certain news). 

Another issue is one fundementally with the MACD strat. MACD is supposed to depict the momentum of price. However, it only is a reflection of price movement. 
Price moves because of an imbalance of buyers and sellers. So if the volume of market participants was low, theoretically, a single trader can move the market by 
points if they wanted to. Is that true momentum? If one person were to sell 10 contracts and move the NASDAQ E-MINI futures by 3 points, and then a bank decides 
to slam the bid, the market can move up by 10 to 15 points. What the MACD fails to do is reflect volume (number of market participants).

To take note of this, on the graph of buy/sell signals generated by the backtest, many of the signals came during overnight sessions, which is ususally when there is lower 
volume compared to RTH (regular trading hours). During these hours it is much easier to have false signals be displayed. 

Another issue of the MACD is that often it is delayed. Trading indicators like the MACD are inherently "this happened" indicators. It is not common to see buy/sell 
signals after the move has occured. This is especially prominent on range days (days where price is going "sideways" stuck between a range of price going up/down constantly
without any real direction). Especially on tight range days, where there is inherently no momentum to one certain side, the MACD is virtually useless, and yet it 
will generate signals.

For example: 
On April 18, after a big move down during the opening, the market started to move sideways. At around 11:10, the MACD indicated a buy signal, but the market remained 
to move sideways, and eventually signals for a sell and 14:10 for a loss. Once again, it signals for a buy, and this time you sell for an even greater loss. This was suring a 
50 point range. For one, volume during "lunch time" is often much lower, and not only that, the price is clearly reflecting that of a range, and yet we recieve signals to enter
trades. This is why when it comes to a strategy like the MACD, the human factor is very important.


A brief view of what will be improved for the backtesting: 
To harness the true value of the MACD (because I do believe it can be profitable, under certain constrictions), we will use certain rules. 

1. Like most traders, trades will be restricted to RTH sessions. One will be the standard 9:30AM EST to 4:00PM EST, and the other 9:30AM to 11:00EST (lunch hours).
2. Buy/sell signals will be restricted at VAH/VAL areas (respectively) to avoid false signals in the range. (Value area high and value area low refers to portions of the range).
3. MACD strat will be incorporated with a set profit target, and set stop loss, so the win percentage can be further improved, and we can lock in profits more often instead of 
    waiting for the next signal.
4. In the distant future, we will record the locations of trades and see the percentages of where and when does the MACD succeed the most.
