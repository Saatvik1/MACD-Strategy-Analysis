Last completed: 
    Fixed errors and had to replace candle stick data library to yfinance from trading views data feed. 
    Added a way for program to create an EMA array for given period x

Need To Do Next:
    Round the values to 100th place (.75)                               DONE 
    Put them in THE data dataframe (maybe rename the variable too)      DONE
    Apply it to graph                                                   DONE
    Make the MACD lines and macd object class                           NOT DONE

Goals:
    Get EMA line on graph <--- DONE

    Add subplot underneat bar graph for MACD analysis                                                       DONE 
    Apply a system to make the MACD based off user input (what emas will be used) <- easy                   DONE?         i think one of the methods has a useless input
    Apply buy and sell markers (if sell is too much just do buy)     <--- challenge                         DONE 
    Calculate statistics of how profitable it is      <--- immediate big goal 
    Calculate other statistics of win rate at different conditions (days, volume, area of price, etc)   <--- long long term goal
